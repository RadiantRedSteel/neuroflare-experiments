# Open–Closed Eyes Experiment

This module is part of the `neuroflare-experiments` repository and is designed to support EEG/EMG-based research on visual attention and baseline brain activity. It is currently a **work in progress** and will be updated as triggers, stimuli, and mood evaluation loops are finalized.

## Overview

The Open–Closed Eyes Experiment is built using PsychoPy and intended for use with a **wireless EEG system and standard EMG monitoring device**. Participants are guided through a series of instructions and timed trials involving alternating eye states.  
These instructions can be found in `psychopy/open-closed/loop-templates/loopOpenClosedIntro.xlsx`.

## TODO:

- Implement two rounds of 5‑minute eyes‑open and eyes‑closed trials  
- Add EEG/EMG trigger orchestration  
- Develop mood evaluation loop (pre‑ and post‑trial)  

## Note

This module is under active development. No participant data will be included in this repository. Please check back for updates!
