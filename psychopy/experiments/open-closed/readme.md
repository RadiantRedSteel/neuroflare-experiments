# Open–Closed Eyes Experiment

This module is part of the `neuroflare-experiments` repository and is designed to support EEG/EMG-based research on visual attention and baseline brain activity.

## Overview

The Open–Closed Eyes Experiment is built using PsychoPy and intended for use with a **wireless EEG system and standard EMG monitoring device**. Participants are guided through a series of instructions and timed trials involving alternating eye states.  
These instructions can be found in `psychopy/open-closed/loop-templates/loopOpenClosedIntro.xlsx`.

## TODO:

- Verify EEG/EMG trigger orchestration  

## Note

This module is under active development. No participant data will be included in this repository. Please check back for updates!
